g remote add origin "ssh address"

// to see success or not
ssh -T git@github.com

// first pull
g pull origin main(origin branch name)

fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
while the fatal here happened, we can set as below
	g config --global pull.rebase false

// then some changes has been made
g add .
g cma 'info'
g push -u origin main(first time)
or (g push) just ok for next time
